Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Framework Overview

RAG is a powerful framework that combines information retrieval with language model generation. Key components include:

1. Document Retrieval:
- Real-time document search
- Multiple retrieval methods (sparse and dense)
- Dynamic content access

2. Retrieval Methods:
- BM25 for sparse retrieval
- Neural embeddings for dense retrieval
- Hybrid approaches combining both

3. Document Processing:
- Chunking and indexing
- Embedding generation
- Relevance scoring

4. Integration with LLMs:
- Context augmentation
- Query reformulation
- Response generation

5. Technical Implementation:
- Vector databases
- Embedding models
- Ranking algorithms

Advantages and Limitations:
RAG provides flexibility in accessing up-to-date information but requires additional computational overhead for retrieval. The framework excels in scenarios where information needs to be dynamically accessed or updated.
