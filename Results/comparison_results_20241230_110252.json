Unlike RAG, CAG doesn't require real-time document retrieval as it preloads and caches knowledge. This eliminates retrieval steps and reduces latency. In addition, CAG provides more consistent access to information, better context understanding through cached knowledge, and more accurate responses. Overall, this leads to lower computational overhead, reduced API calls, improved response times, and reduced latency in response generation.",
